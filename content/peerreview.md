## Commitment to Quality

To maintain high academic standards, all manuscripts submitted to Yamanami Books undergo a rigorous peer review process prior to publication.

## The Review Procedure

1. Initial Screening: Upon submission, the editorial team conducts a preliminary check to ensure the manuscript aligns with our scope and the quality we demand.
2. Expert Review: Manuscripts are entrusted to external subject-matter experts for evaluation. The specific methodology is selected based on the standards and requirements of the specific academic field.
3. Verification: Yamanami Books verifies the legitimacy and impartiality of the review process for every title to ensure ethical standards are met.
4. Decision: Based on the experts' advises, the publisher makes a final decision to accept, request revisions, or reject the manuscript.

Only manuscripts that pass this rigorous evaluation are approved for publication. For journals, the editorial board of each journal shall establish its own individual regulations.
