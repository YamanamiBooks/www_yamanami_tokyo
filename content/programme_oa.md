## Our Mission
Yamanami Books is a Japan-based academic publisher dedicated to the dissemination of scholarly knowledge. As one of the few publishers in Japan specializing in Open Access monographs, our mission is to facilitate global access to high-quality research without barriers. While our primary focus is on scientific and academic books, we welcome any work that contributes significantly to the advancement of learning and culture.

## Publishing Model
We operate under a "Gold Open Access" model. This ensures that all published monographs are immediately and freely available to readers worldwide upon publication. To ensure the permanence and discoverability of our content, every electronic book and journal article is assigned a Digital Object Identifier (DOI).

## Global Distribution
In addition to digital distribution, we utilize a print-on-demand (POD) system. This approach prevents titles from going out of print and allows us to distribute physical copies not only within Japan but also through printing facilities globally, ensuring that researchers can access our publications in their preferred format.
