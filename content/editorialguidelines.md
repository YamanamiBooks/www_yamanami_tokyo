## Submission Standards

Yamanami Books accepts manuscripts that contribute to academic advancement across various disciplines, with a focus on scientific research. Authors are required to ensure their work is original and has not been published elsewhere.

## Technical Editing

Once a manuscript has passed the peer review process, it undergoes technical editing by the publisher. This stage ensures that the layout, formatting, and metadata meet international standards for digital and print distribution.

## Digital Object Identifiers (DOI)

We assign a DOI to every book and chapter we publish to ensure persistent citation and linkage. Authors are expected to provide accurate metadata and references to facilitate this process.

## Organisation

Yamanami Books is organized to support researchers through a transparent and efficient publishing workflow. Our editorial team oversees the entire process from the coordination of expert peer reviews to the final technical production.
